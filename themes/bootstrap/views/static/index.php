		<h1>Welcome to Annex, the Kohana CMS</h1>
		<p>
			Annex was created to solve a problem: Very few modern content management systems were designed for
			both the developer and the end user. We wanted to build Annex in a way that would give the ultimate 
			power and flexibility while still remaining highly plug-and-play.

			<h2>Public Wrappers</h2>
			<p>
				<code>annex/themes/default/views/wrapper.php</code>
				<code>annex/classes/controller/public.php</code>
				<code>annex/classes/controller/public/annex.php</code>
			</p>
			<p>
				The public wrapper is built right into the core of annex 
				and can be extended from the module to build out custom login forms 
				by either overriding the default theme, applying your own custom theme,
				or communicating directly with the annex login controller with post data.
